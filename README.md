# Smart Surveillance Analysis System using a Vision–Language Model
-	This notebook implements a smart surveillance analysis system using a Vision–Language Model (VLM).
-	It loads a pre-trained LLaVA model, processes uploaded CCTV images, and applies a structured prompt to analyze the scene without identifying individuals.
-	The system generates descriptive outputs covering the scene context, potential risks, abnormal activities, and overall risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH).
-	The notebook demonstrates end-to-end inference, from image upload and preprocessing to controlled text generation, focusing on safety-oriented scene understanding.
